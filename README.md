# 2018 Mi Notebook Pro 15 GTX Drivers

I’ve decided to upload the drivers for this laptop to GitHub since the [official site](https://www.mi.com/service/bijiben/drivers/15-game-gtx) is down and the only other site I was able to download the drivers from was [here](https://c.mi.com/thread-2167073-1-0.html), which has the same ones that are in this repo as of 14/11/2021.

## Drivers not included:
- Intel Graphics: Use the installer from Intel’s website.
- Nvidia Graphics: Use the installer from Nvidia’s website.

These drivers are made for Windows 10, I haven’t tried them on Windows 11.
