<h4>One-Year Limited Hardware Warranty</h4>
<h4>Limited Warranty</h4>
<p>In this warranty statement, the term &quot;Product&quot; applies to the wireless adapters listed in <a href="specs.htm">Specifications</a>.</p>

<p>Intel warrants to the purchaser of the Product that the Product, if properly used and installed, will be free from defects in material and workmanship and will substantially conform to Intel&rsquo;s publicly available specifications for the Product for a period of one (1) year beginning on the date the Product was purchased in its original sealed packaging.</p>
<p>SOFTWARE OF ANY KIND DELIVERED WITH OR AS PART OF THE PRODUCT IS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED "AS IS", SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDING ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE), provided however, that Intel warrants that the media on which the software is furnished will be free from defects for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of delivery. If such a defect appears within the warranty period, you may return the defective media to Intel for replacement or alternative delivery of the software at Intel's discretion and without charge. Intel does not warrant or assume responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any information, text, graphics, links or other items contained within the software.</p>

<p>If the Product which is the subject of this Limited Warranty fails during the warranty period for reasons covered by this Limited Warranty, Intel, at its option, will:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>REPAIR</strong> the Product by means of hardware and/or software; OR</li>

<li><strong>REPLACE</strong> the Product with another product, OR, if Intel is unable to repair or replace the Product,</li>

<li><strong>REFUND</strong> the then-current Intel price for the Product at the time a claim for warranty service is made to Intel under this Limited Warranty.</li>
</ul>

<p>THIS LIMITED WARRANTY, AND ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES THAT MAY EXIST UNDER APPLICABLE STATE, NATIONAL, PROVINCIAL OR LOCAL LAW, APPLY ONLY TO YOU AS THE ORIGINAL PURCHASER OF THE PRODUCT.</p>

<h4>Extent of Limited Warranty</h4>

<p>Intel does not warrant that the Product, whether purchased stand-alone or integrated with other products, including without limitation, semi-conductor components, will be free from design defects or errors known as "errata." Current characterized errata are available upon request. Further, this Limited Warranty does NOT cover: (i) any costs associated with the replacement or repair of the Product, including labor, installation or other costs incurred by you, and in particular, any costs relating to the removal or replacement of any Product soldered or otherwise permanently affixed to any printed circuit board or integrated with other products; (ii) damage to the Product due to external causes, including accident, problems with electrical power, abnormal, mechanical or environmental conditions, usage not in accordance with product instructions, misuse, neglect, accident, abuse, alteration, repair, improper or unauthorized installation or improper testing, or (iii) any Product which has been modified or operated outside of Intel&rsquo;s publicly available specifications or where the original product identification markings (trademark or serial number) have been removed, altered or obliterated from the Product; or (iv) issues resulting from modification (other than by Intel) of software products provided or included in the Product, (v) incorporation of software products, other than those software products provided or included in the Product by Intel, or (vi) failure to apply Intel-supplied modifications or corrections to any software provided with or included in the Product.</p>

<h4>How to Obtain Warranty Service</h4>

<p>To obtain warranty service for the Product, you may contact your original place of purchase in accordance with its instructions or you may contact Intel. To request warranty service from Intel, you must contact the Intel Customer Support ("ICS") center in your region (<a href="http://www.intel.com/support/wireless/">http://www.intel.com/support/wireless/</a>) within the warranty period during normal business hours (local time), excluding holidays and return the Product to the designated ICS center. Please be prepared to provide: (1) your name, mailing address, email address, telephone numbers and, in the USA, valid credit card information; (2) proof of purchase; (3) model name and product identification number found on the Product; and (4) an explanation of the problem. The Customer Service Representative may need additional information from you depending on the nature of the problem. Upon ICS's verification that the Product is eligible for warranty service, you will be issued a Return Material Authorization ("RMA") number and provided with instructions for returning the Product to the designated ICS center. When you return the Product to the ICS center, you must include the RMA number on the outside of the package. Intel will not accept any returned Product without an RMA number, or that has an invalid RMA number, on the package. You must deliver the returned Product to the designated ICS center in the original or equivalent packaging, with shipping charges pre-paid (within the USA), and assume the risk of damage or loss during shipment. Intel may elect to repair or replace the Product with either a new or reconditioned Product or components, as Intel deems appropriate. The repaired or replaced product will be shipped to you at the expense of Intel within a reasonable period of time after receipt of the returned Product by ICS. The returned Product shall become Intel&rsquo;s property on receipt by ICS. The replacement product is warranted under this written warranty and is subject to the same limitations of liability and exclusions for ninety (90) days or the remainder of the original warranty period, whichever is longer. If Intel replaces the Product, the Limited Warranty period for the replacement Product is not extended.</p>
