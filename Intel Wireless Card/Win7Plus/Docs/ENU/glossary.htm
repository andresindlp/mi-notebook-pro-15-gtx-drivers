The main difference is that EAP-FAST does not use certificates to authenticate.</p><p>Provisioning in EAP-FAST is negotiated solely by the client as the first communication exchange when EAP-FAST is requested from the server. If the client does not have a pre-shared secret Protected Access Credential (PAC), it can request to initiate a provisioning EAP-FAST exchange to dynamically obtain one from the server.</p><p>EAP-FAST documents two methods to deliver the PAC: manual delivery through an out-of-band secure mechanism, and automatic provisioning.</p><ul><li><p>Manual delivery mechanisms can be any delivery mechanism that the administrator of the network feels is sufficiently secure for their network.</p></li><li><p>Automatic provisioning establishes an encrypted tunnel to protect the authentication of the client and the delivery of the PAC to the client. This mechanism, while not as secure as a manual method may be, is more secure than the authentication method used in LEAP.</p></li></ul><p>The EAP-FAST method can be divided into two parts: provisioning, and authentication.

<tr><td><p>TTLS (Tunneled Transport Layer Security)</p></td>
<td><p><a name="ttls" id="ttls"></a>These settings define the protocol and the credentials used to authenticate a user. In TTLS, the client uses EAP-TLS to validate the server and create a TLS-encrypted channel between the client and server. The client can use another authentication protocol. Typically password-based protocols challenge over this encrypted channel to enable server validation. The challenge and response packets are sent over a non-exposed TLS encrypted channel. TTLS implementations today support all methods defined by EAP, as well as several older methods (CHAP, PAP, MS-CHAP and MS-CHAP-V2). TTLS can easily be extended to work with new protocols by defining new attributes to support new protocols.</p></td>

WEP is a security protocol for wireless local area networks (WLANs) defined in the 802.11b standard. WEP is designed to provide the same level of security as that of a wired LAN. WEP aims to provide security by data over radio waves so that it is protected as it is transmitted from one end point to another.</p></td>

WPA is a Wi-Fi standard that was designed to improve upon the security features of WEP as follows:
